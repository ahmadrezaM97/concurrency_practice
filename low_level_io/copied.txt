Baseline is the expectation for a just-senior engineer, development are the expectations for senior engineers. 

Tech
Baseline

Autonomously builds and deploys new features or bug fixes

Writes well-structured and readable code which follows our conventions

Autonomously deploys code changes

Performs post-deployment monitoring to check for validity, errors, and changes to global business KPIs

Example: uses Pivot to gain insights (e.g. if a deploy affected some basic KPIs)

Adds tests for new or existing features following existing patterns

Performs simple investigations into issues in area of expertise

Example: debugs code by following stack traces and using log messages

Reviews code using our guidelines and against task requirements

Breaks down complex tasks down into simpler, individually deployable changes

Comfortable testing complex code, introduces new test patterns

Gathers data from multiple sources (e.g. logs, raw data, metrics) and presents research clearly, avoiding all assumptions

Performs post-deployment monitoring to check for errors, changes to global business KPIs, and technical KPIs (e.g. increase in bid time, memory usage, or Kafka throughput)

Development target:

Produces and implements designs spanning a single service (e.g. introduced a new service for tracking spend)

Strives to find the simplest solution to a problem

Does not overcomplicate / over engineer solutions 

Considers scalability and maintainability when writing and reviewing code

Example: does this perform at 2x the scale or introduce something we will need to refactor soon?

Instruments code where necessary and makes those metrics available through new or existing dashboards. Thinks carefully about potential incidents or error cases and adds appropriate alerting

Investigates issues across multiple systems using prior knowledge of services, technical KPI observations, and external impacts

Considers infrastructure-wide implications when writing and reviewing code

Example: does this cause an increase in Kafka throughput that consumers will struggle with?

Achieves Technical Level 1 also into areas of DATA and COR

Team
Baseline

Effectively works as a member of a project team (contributing towards task discussions, retrospectives, and presentations)

Takes ownership of changes they introduced (post-deployment questions and issues, documentation)

Helps team members with getting to know new parts of the system, investigating issue and finding optimal solutions

Gives structured, constructive and actionable feedback to colleagues when asked

Reaches out to other departments for information and assistance (e.g. for partner integrations)

Is able to communicate ideas and technical concepts within the team effectively (so that others understand, are aware of shortcoming, able to verify)

Development Target

Involved in the recruitment process by performing interviews and giving feedback on the candidates performance

Supports other engineers by mentoring them (support, knowledge sharing)

Effectively leads project teams, involving organisation of tasks, scope management, and communication with the product team.

Product & Process
Baseline

Actively flags own tasks which are blocked by raising them with the team (e.g. waiting for a review for over a week, struggling to find a solution, or waiting for information)

Asks relevant team members to help determine the impacts of approaches to a feature, bug or on-call issue

Able to judge if the effort of their task exceeds the allotted time complexity.

Creates tasks for bugs fixes and smaller implementation improvements containing a description of the problem

Actively participates in the retrospective by providing feedback to the process

Cooperates with product to write technical concepts for individual tasks of their area of expertise

Development Target

Can accurately estimate effort and impact of tasks the defined to correctly prioritise them

Writes sufficiently detailed task descriptions so other team members can pick them up and flags tickets for which this is not the case

Identifies problems in the development or product process and proposes solutions

Asks relevant stakeholders to clarify business impact of the tickets they are working on
